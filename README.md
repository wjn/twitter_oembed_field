Symphony CMS Twitter oEmbed Field

Because Symphony Does not yet support Bitbucket (which gives unlimited private repos for FREE) this repo is a placeholder for the bitbucket repository that is private at this time. This is done to allow [Symphony's XML schema](http://getsymphony.com/schemas/extension/1.0) to validate.

When the Bitbucket repository is ready for public consumption it will be accessible at [https://bitbucket.org/wjnielsen/twitter-oembed-field](https://bitbucket.org/wjnielsen/twitter-oembed-field).
